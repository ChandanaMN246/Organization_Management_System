# Organization_Management_System

This is a Java web project called "Organization Management System" developed using Eclipse Enterprise Edition with Tomcat server and MySQL database connectivity. The project utilizes various technologies including HTML, CSS, Servlet, and JDBC, and is created as an Eclipse Dynamic Project.

Description:
The Organization Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline and manage organizational operations efficiently. It provides functionalities for administrators to handle employee, HR, and manager records separately. The system ensures secure access through a login page where the administrator must enter their username and password. Access is granted only if the password matches the stored credentials.

Features:

Login Page: The login page serves as the entry point for administrators. They need to enter their username and password for authentication.
Employee Management: Once authenticated, administrators have the ability to add, delete, and view employee records. This functionality enables effective management of employee information, including personal details, job roles, and contact information.

HR Management: The system provides a dedicated section for HR records. Administrators can perform similar operations such as adding, deleting, and viewing HR details. This allows efficient management of HR-related information.

Manager Management: The system also includes a separate module for managing manager records. Administrators can add, delete, and view details specific to managers. This functionality assists in organizing manager-related information, such as their roles, responsibilities, and team assignments.

Technologies Used:

HTML: Used for structuring and presenting the web pages, ensuring an intuitive user interface.

CSS: Employed to enhance the design and layout of the web application, creating a visually appealing user experience.
Servlet: Used as the server-side technology to handle user requests and responses, interact with the database, and generate dynamic web content.

JDBC: Enables the connection between the Java application and the MySQL database server, allowing database operations such as storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting data.
Development Environment:

Eclipse Enterprise Edition: Used as the integrated development environment (IDE) for developing the project. Eclipse offers features like code completion, debugging, and project management, facilitating efficient development and testing.
